        <h1> About me </h1>
        <p> I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate that just got a ""job"" by recomendation and it's currently strugling to learn all the technologies needed for actually being useful. I started by Next.js but Dave Gray (the teacher from the video I choose) said that I needed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Typescript (wich is actually great cause people from Laud√°rio are using it) and Tailwind CSS. All of that just to learn Next.js.</p>

        <h2> You know what!? </h2>
        <p>I'm doing it. You can check my development journey at my github: <a href = "https://github.com/BalieroGu" target ="_blank"> balieroGu</a></p>
